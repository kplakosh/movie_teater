# CRUD - Create, Read, Update, and Delete

In this little app I'm truking the movies with their reiting. It's do one of four things: add a new movie to a hash, update the rating for an existing movie, display the movies and ratings that are already in the hash, or delete a movie from the hash. If it doesn't receive one of those four commands, the program output error message.
